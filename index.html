            <p>Hi! My name is Alfred. I was born in Jakarta on the 3rd of July 1999. My nationality is Indonesia, which is my native language as well. However, I enjoy speaking in English, since I came to Melbourne as an International student. Currently, I am doing my first year of  Bachelor degree in Information Technology at RMIT University and completed my Diploma of Engineering last year at Monash University. What makes me choose this major is related to my hobby, which is playing computer games that are competitive multiplayer games for example Dota2 and Rainbow six siege. One interesting fact about me is, I also enjoy cooking Western and Japanese cuisine, especially in my leisure time. I was inspired by an animation movie, called Ratatouille. This movie tells how a provincial rat has a wonderful sense of smell, discovers real food and the cooking of a five-star chef.

        <div id="Interest" class="w3-container info" style="display:none ">
            <h2><b>Interest in IT</b></h2>
            <p>
            My interests in IT are related to the game industry and creative industry. I started my interest when I played the game RuneScape back in elementary school then played a lot more games in high school, likewise, I did a lot of content creation by using Adobe Software.
            </p>
            <p>
            There is no particular event and person that inspired me on IT, however, this urge comes from my own curiosity which drives me to learn more about it. Back to my old times, when I was playing a game and using software, I wondered how they are made and how they come up with all these features.
            </p>
            <p>
            My curiosity brings me to look up for things and do a lot of research on how to program , how the IT Industry should go, how things are supposed to work, and how prospective it is to work in the IT industry. Before entering this bachelor, I gained many experiences in coding. For example, I learned how to make a simple program using C++, Python, and JavaScript during my diploma.
            </p>
            <p>
            I chose RMIT due to its learning style which is more practical compared to my previous Uni.  Instead of studying theoretically, it hands on what we are learning. 
            </p>
            <p>
            I am expecting to learn deeper about the IT industry, and how to behave and work in the IT environment. Particularly, I want to learn more about software development and gain skills on it. I believe, through software development, I can use that skill in the gaming and creative industry. 
            </p>

            <h2><b>Ideal Job</b></h2>
            <a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/jobs?job_id=12"> Visit the job page here!</a>
            <h4>Job description</h4>
            <p>
            My ideal job based on what I found currently is becoming an Anti-Cheat engineer in Valve. The job is to become software engineer that focuses on game Anti-Cheat software. There will be a lot Researching, designing and developing new Anti-Cheat software for each of their games. This job interest me because I have been fond with Valve games such as Dota2, Counterstrike, and many more. I’m interested in the development process and how they manage to stop Cheating from happening. Plus, as Anti-Cheat Software Engineer there will be a lot of opportunities to test games on their development period and I enjoy playing games also giving feedback.
            </p>
            <h4>Required Skills</h4>
            <p>
            Based on their qualification needs they first ask for someone who has a bachelor’s degree in computer engineering or equivalent. They are looking for people with strong analysis, debugging, and reverse engineering skills. This job requires someone with 5 year of experiences with C/C++ and in-depth knowledge of windows platforms, windows process management, dynamic link libraries, memory management, using networking technologies in large-scale systems or gaming platforms, and taking a computer software product or video game for conception and development through publication and product shipment.
            </p>
            <h4>Current Skills</h4>
            <p>
            Comparing my current skills, qualification, and experience is that based on my degree I’m doing bachelor’s in IT. Based on skill I’m started my learning with C++ 2 years ago and I did some works on windows platforms. On experiences I’m still lacking a lot working in IT environment or even gaming industries. 
            </p>
            <h4>Plan</h4>
            <p>
            To get the job that I want, I need to start to plan out my study at RMIT by picking elective classes that relates to computer engineering so that I will have knowledge around computer engineering. For the subjects It will be depending on what RMIT have and what I can be enrolled into. Then I should look for part-time job in Indie game studios in Melbourne that will get me the experience developing a game from the beginning. With all that automatically I will be exposed to a lot of programming and thinking with the related skills.

            </ul>
            <p>
            Personality test is a very common test to describe and evaluate a person’s personality characteristics. I did the 3 personality tests such as Myer-Briggs test, learning styles test, and Big Five Personality test to understand how well I perform in my work circumstances. First, the Myer-Briggs test really tells me who I am, that I am a very debating person, and it proves me that I am an open-minded person and love to give ideas. Changing one idea to another idea is very easy for me as well. Secondly, the learning style test shows that I am an auditory learner which means that it is more effective for me to learn through listening or in other words, it tells me that I am a good listener in terms of studying. As an auditory learner, I am prone to distract others by fidgeting pens or anything and people might think that I am not paying attention, but I am listening to understand everything that's being said. Finally, the Big Five Personality test shows the 5 major dimensions of personality. The highest percentages that I got are on openness and extraversion. Openness means that I tend to think in abstract, complex, and creative ways. I enjoy playing with ideas and discovering new experiences. And then, extraversion describes me as a form of attention seeker, looking for stimulation, engaging actively to earn a social bond. For me, I feel that I achieve a goal by getting a promotion and winning an award which makes me satisfied as an extraversion person.  
            </p>
            <p>Based on my result, it shows me how I would behave when working in a team. I can see from the Myer-Briggs test that I would give out more ideas in my team and sometimes, it depends on me on how I would perceive my colleagues and how I appreciate their ideas as well. Since I am a debater, I might contest my teammates if their ideas are not logical. Moreover, I will be able to listen for others easily and absorb on what they are saying. And it will help me to understand my colleagues on what they are trying to deliver and to know how everything is going in my team. The last test that I did tells me that I really open into the new ideas, not only holding onto my own ideas because it’s flexible for me to change from idea to idea if I agree to it. 
            </p>
            <p>In forming a team, it will be much easier because now I know what type of people that I look for. They are people who are less sensitive since I could be insensitive toward others,  so, it means that I need a team member who has a high level of understanding or knowledge on what I just said, consequently, it won’t hurt their feelings. Furthermore, I should look for people who can engage more with me because when I put up information, they should be able to absorb that information and think about it together with me. And also for the team leader, he/she should understand me as well, that I could give some good information because I am an analytical person and I would like to give the best answer every time I am being asked.

        <div id="Project" class="w3-container info" style="display:none ">
            <h2><b>Project Idea</b></h2>
            <h4><b>Overview</b></h4>
            <p>
            A project that I was thinking a couple of time is an app that automate computer to do file system management. The app could automate moving files, uninstalling unnecessary installs, control junk files, and simplify the use of scripting for many people without the knowledge of coding. This app provides flexibility for Windows/Mac users (Linux future compatibility) to have a companion that will help organise system files and software’s manually but more importantly automatically. This app should be completely usable when offline to also increase its security and does not affect the computer performance. This app will be called Valet.
            </p>
            <h4><b>Motivation</b></h4>
            <p>
            My motivation on this making this app is to create a very reliable and easy way to control my windows computer file system. Things that make me frustrated using a computer is when downloading many things could clutter the download folder and unnecessary software’s that is installed to the computer causing the computer to lose performance. This app idea motivation is mostly personal motivation to improve my daily life using the computer. I think this kind of software is needed to be made and there must be people who has the same problem as I am.
            </p>
            <h4><b>Description</b></h4>
            <p>
            First on what the app should do in the user computer. This app should start off with installation that will setup the file directory or folder which the app needs to focus on organising. User will then select the types of file the app should manage and where to make a new folder.
            </p>
            <p>
            The app should be completely workable even when it’s not connected to the Internet. There will be two version of this app one which is a free standalone application which doesn’t need internet connection and one paid subscription plus mode that includes extra features.
            </p>
            <p>Free version</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Manages folder autonomously</li>
                <li>Clears unnecessary files or program</li>
                <li>Uninstalling unwanted vanilla software</li>
                <li>Custom scripting program</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Plus version</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Manages folder autonomously with specific algorith for different data types</li>
                <li>Clears unnecessary files or program</li>
                <li>Uninstalling unwanted vanilla software</li>
                <li>Custom scripting program</li>
                <li>Support mobile device</li>
                <li>Security update based on the user need</li>
                <li>Set timed events for the app to  do specified jobs (Ex. opening another app) </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            The app should have a graphic interface where the user can see information  on what the app have been doing and it is where users could change their settings. On top of that, there should be a section for user to create custom program that can be executed by the app to furthermore expand the usability of the app.
            </p>
            <p>
            The app would be lightweight, so it won’t affect the computer performance and supports majority of the computers. Unlike anti-virus software’s this app should not be disturbing the user workflow and works seamlessly with the user preferences.
            </p>
            <p>
            Since there will be a limit on how powerful the app should be. The app will have drawbacks on how many features it will have progressively. But there can be another option on expanding the feature of the app by using cloud-based service. This means new or experimental feature of the app could be fetch from a server and managed by the developer which can lower the need of storage requirement. This is unnecessary but it could make the quality of app be controlled much easier by the developer.
            </p>
            <p>                
            The app must be totally functional even when its on the free version and the plus version should just be just for paying an expert to do it. The pricing can’t be decided now but it be a subscription method and not a one-time purchase. This could lead to users to stick to the free version but if the user is not familiar with the coding or scripting then they would prefer to pay extra to gain expert knowledge.
            </p>
            <h4><b>Tools and Technology</b></h4>
            <p>Programming Languages</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Python (using phyton GTK+3 library for Interface)</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>Swift (MacOS Version)</li>
            </ol>
            <p> 
            Technology that will be used is version control trough Github and scalable for many developers for later stage. It also give access to other people if this software goes to the open source route.
            </p>
            <p>
            To make this software there won’t be much need of future technology since nowadays computer are capable enough to run simple software. But if there is a new technology in the computer system it should be easy to implement it to this.
            </p>
            <h4><b>Skills Required</b></h4>
            <p>
            Programming skill is needed in Python, Java, and swift is required to work on the software making so there will be no hindrance and it should be easier to solve logic problems. There should be more practice in programming languages that is needed 
            </p>
            <h4><b>Outcome</b></h4>
            <p>
            The outcome of this software idea will be very good when it reaches success. There will be many people would feel less frustrated with the file system of the computer nowadays. The software itself would fix the main problem which is managing messy folder in computer by organising the user pointed folder to a much tidier version of itself. If this software succeeded more than expected than it will be alarming Microsoft or Apple to start to work on their own version of this software imbedded in the operating system which will force the big companies to innovate in this area of computer system.
