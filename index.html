    <h2> Personal Information</h2>
        <p>Hi! My name is Alfred. I was born in Jakarta on the 3rd of July 1999. My nationality is Indonesia, which is my native language as well. However, I enjoy speaking in English, since I came to Melbourne as an International student. Currently, I am doing my first year of  Bachelor degree in Information Technology at RMIT University and completed my Diploma of Engineering last year at Monash University. What makes me choose this major is related to my hobby, which is playing computer games that are competitive multiplayer games for example Dota2 and Rainbow six siege. One interesting fact about me is, I also enjoy cooking Western and Japanese cuisine, especially in my leisure time. I was inspired by an animation movie, called Ratatouille. This movie tells how a provincial rat has a wonderful sense of smell, discovers real food and the cooking of a five-star chef.</p>
